## Geckos, agriculture and cats...

```{block, type="task"}
**Geckos**

This time we are working on tree living geckos. They are meant to be threatened by landuse change (intensity of agriculture) and cats (density of cats).

A friend of yours has sampled 20 individual geckos in a fairly agricultural area. He has two main hypothesis: geckos are limited in their dispersal by the agricultural intensity and also by cat density.

Unfortunately he has no idea about Landscape genetics. Can you help him to check which of the two hypothesis are most likely true?

You can find the data here: [https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/dartRworkshop/tree/master/WEEG/Prac1_Mon/data](https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/dartRworkshop/tree/master/WEEG/Prac1_Mon/data)

- geckos_snps.csv (snp file)
- geckos_locs.csv (xy locations)
- agriculture (intensity of agricultuer [0-1])
- catdensity (density of cats [0-1]) 


```




```{block, type="finish"}

Now that you have hopefully solved that mystery, why not having a well deserved break and a beverage?

```
